,Notes:  Disease rates are calculated using population estimates for the selected year from Statistics New Zealand.  Rates of disease have not been calculated where the numerator has fewer than 5 cases.  The number of cases is shown so that cases can be combined into larger totals e.g. several years or wider age groups.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
